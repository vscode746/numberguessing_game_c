Problem:
 This is going to be fun!
  We will write a program that generates random number and asks the player to guess it. If the player's guess is higher then the actual number the program display " Lower number please" Similarly if the user's quess is too low, the program prints "Higher number please".

When the user quesses the correct number, the program displays the number of quesses the player used to arrive at the number.

hint:use loops
use a random number generator
